# EV Range Estimator

## Overview
This project estimates the driving range of an electric vehicle based on available battery energy and vehicle efficiency.

It provides a simplified real-world calculation used in EV performance analysis.

## How It Works
The program:
- Converts battery capacity from kWh to Wh
- Calculates usable energy based on State of Charge (SoC)
- Divides usable energy by vehicle efficiency (Wh/km)
- Outputs the estimated driving range in kilometers

## Inputs Required
- Battery Capacity (kWh)
- Vehicle Efficiency (Wh/km)
- Current SoC (%)

## Output
- Estimated driving range (km)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3

## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates:
- Energy conversion concepts
- Practical EV range estimation logic
- Clean function-based Python structure
- Basic input validation

## Possible Extensions
- Add temperature impact factor
- Include regenerative braking efficiency
- Build a graphical interface
